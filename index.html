                        <h2>Why Make the Change</h2>
                        <p class="lead"><br>Hi! My name is Cat. I am a college student at James Madison University who recently made many lifestyle changes to help make the world a greener place. When it comes to "living green", many people feel daunted by the task. As humans, we have normalized a society of mass overconsumption and struggle coping with the idea of giving any of it up. Oftentimes, we convince ourselves sustainable swaps won't work as well or are too expensive. Well, I am here to show you that making sustainable swaps doesn't have to be the downgrade it is made out to be. </p>
                        <p class="lead"> Recently, I studied abroad in Sweden. It made me realize that sustainable living on a large scale is not out of reach. Swedes make a conscious effort to combat overconsumption and have adjusted their daily habits correspondingly, making them the most sustainable country in the world. The United States could have this reality but we have not yet made the necessary adjustments. The change can start with you! All it takes is one small change to inspire yourself and those around you to put prioritizing the health of our planet on the forefront. Your efforts make a difference!</p>

Takeout and fast food use excess amounts of single use plastics and likely aren't good for us either. Learning to cook for yourself is not only a great life skill, but it is great for the planet and your overall health! Here are some ways to do so sustainably:  </p>

Don't buy more than you can eat and focus on pantry stable goods such as pasta, beans, and jarred vegetables. You can also learn some hacks on how to make the most of your food scraps such as using carrot tops to make pesto or vegetable scraps to make homemade broth!  </p>

I've found reuseable bags to be better in every way. Personally, I use a large insulated beach bag so I can carry all my groceries on one shoulder. Easier, more chic, and more sustainable! (Don't forget about reuseable produce bags, containers, and water bottles too!)

                                P.S. If you are a JMU student, use the reuseable containers offered on campus! Another incredibly easy change that makes a difference. </p>

That leads me to my first tip: thrift! Thrifting is the most sustainable (and inexpensive) way to shop but if that is not your style, try investing in timelesss, high-quality pieces that will last. And if there is one thing you do, DITCH MICROTRENDS AND FAST FASHION! </p>

                                Getting comfortable having less is a great way to live green. Personally, cutting my closet in half was one of the best things I did for my mental health. It helped me narrow down on my style (making shopping easier) and remove lots of clutter. Make sure you donate your clothing to a local donation center or thrift store.

                                <p class="card-text">Quality over quantity. Try investing in pieces you can see yourself wearing often and do your best to avoid buying things just for one night. Consider renting for those situations instead. This way you can still have a special outfit for the night without overconsuming. I recommend trying Nuuly for rental clothing! </p>

                        <p class="lead">In an era where health and wellness routines are so abundent, we are constantly feeling the pressure to buy more more more. Most brands use plastic packaging, meaning your bathroom is likely full of single-use plastics. I have found some practical swaps that allow you to keep your routines without the extra waste. </p>

                                <p class="card-text">Switching your shower routine to 100% bar products will not only reduce plastic use but will also free up lots of space in your shower. Many people fear they won't get the lather they desire, but it really is just as effective, I promise! Next time you run out of shampoo or conditioner, ditch the bottle and try these out. </p>

Keep it simple with a short effective routine, that doesn't build up excess plastic and clutter. </p>

If you take away anything from this website, choose reuseable as often as you can. It helps you become more aware of how much single use plastic you use everyday. </p>
